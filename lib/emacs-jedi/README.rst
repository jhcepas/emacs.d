What is it?
===========

Jedi.el is a Python auto-completion package for Emacs.
It aims at helping your Python coding in a non-destructive way.
It also helps you to find information about Python objects, such as
docstring, function arguments and code location.

Jedi.el uses jedi_ (an awesome Python auto-completion library) and
EPC_ (an RPC stack for Emacs Lisp) and its `Python binding`_ to
communicate with Python process.  It also uses excellent Emacs
auto-complete_ module to start completion automatically.  As Jedi.el
always calls Python function asynchronously (thanks to EPC_), it will
not block your Emacs while your are editing.

Requirements
============

Emacs
-----
- EPC_
- deferred.el_ (> v0.3)
- auto-complete_

If your completion popup is broken when width of completion candidates
is wide, try the newest version of popup.el_.

.. _deferred.el: https://github.com/kiwanami/emacs-deferred
.. _popup.el: https://github.com/auto-complete/popup-el

Python
------
- Jedi_
- python-epc_
- argparse (for Python 2.6)

Jedi.el is tested against Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.2.

Optional dependencies for automatic installation:
-------------------------------------------------
- virtualenv
- make


Install
=======

el-get
------

The easiest way to install Jedi.el is to use el-get_:
just do ``M-x el-get-install jedi``.
You need to have `virtualenv` to automatically install Python module
dependencies.  If your el-get does not have the recipes for Jedi.el
yet, get them from `this pull request`_.

Manual install
--------------

1. Install EPC_ and auto-complete_.
2. Install Jedi.el.  Download the repository of Jedi.el and add it to
   `load-path`.
3. Install Jedi_ and python-epc_ by

   - ``make requirements`` or
   - ``pip install jedi epc`` if you want to determine where to
     install them.

4. Add ``(autoload 'jedi:setup "jedi" nil t)`` in your Emacs configuration.


Setup
=====

All you need to do is to call `jedi:setup` in python buffer.
To do that, add the following in your Emacs configuration::

   (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'jedi:setup)

If auto-completion is all you need, use `jedi:ac-setup` instead::

   (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'jedi:ac-setup)

To setup recommended keybinds for Jedi.el, add this to your Emacs
configuration.  Note that you must set `jedi:setup-keys` *before*
loading `jedi.el`.  See its docstring (``<f1> v jedi:setup-keys``) for
more information.::

   (setq jedi:setup-keys t)


Extension
=========

IPython integration
-------------------

Sometimes it is useful to find completion using Python interpreter.
To do that in a seamless manner, you can use IPython and its Emacs
binding EIN (Emacs IPython Notebook).  See ein:jedi-setup_ in the EIN
manual.  Using this setup, you can run auto-completion command in
Jedi.el and EIN simultaneously.
